Greetings Starbeing — I’m Nick Ng (pronounced ‘ing’) and my pronouns are he/him/his. If I could live in any city, it would be pre-Yahoo Geocities.

This README is a work-in-progress, which I hope that it will be useful for anyone who collobrates with me.

- I work on [Login.gov](https://login.gov), improving government digital identity experience for the American public 
  - Prevously a product design practice lead at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)
  - Currently, a co-organizer lead at [A11yChi](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/)
- I’m currently thinking about
  - Accessibility challenges and opportunities of biometrics and authenticators
  - Experience of those with non-traditional residencies
  - Omurice, omurice, omurice 🍳🍚🔴
  
In another dimension where software isn’t eating the world — career-wise, I would somehow find a way to have a dim sum teahouse / tempura bar in the spirit of [Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCGDVHjPX0c).


## Disabilities

I am deaf/hard-of-hearing (DHH). Culturally, I identify as Deaf and my primary language is American Sign Language (ASL). Regarding English spoken language, I had speech/auditory training for 15 years and am still struggling to pronounce words from time to time, like “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” Also, amblyopia that decreases vision in one of my eyes.

## Time zone and scheduling

Central Time (CT) zone is my jam. 🤘  I appreciate a 24-hour notice before scheduling a meeting, and ideally, my schedule would look like this ...

|Mornings 🌅|Late mornings and afternoons ☀️|Late afternoons 🌇|hoot, hoot🦉🌌|
|---|---|---|---|
|Heads down time, standups and/or brief 1:1 meetings|Large meetings and/or workshops|Heads down time, virtual tea/coffee/fika, informal 1:1s|Being a nightowl, I occasionally relax my mind by working on low-hanging fruits.|

## Hobbies/Interests
I experiment in [creative coding](https://twitter.com/nickttng/status/1048245481548275712) in a variety of languages, mitigate stress by [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5682026-nick-ng), and find reasons to go for a walk (and to camp). Occasionally, I have heavy cases of [dès vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPKoIZn6IJI). 

On the side, I am a co-organizer lead at [A11yChi](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/), bringing together like-minded individuals advocating for accessibility and inclusive design. At [DeafKidsCode](https://www.deafkidscode.org/), I serve as a trustee to make technology learning accessible to Deaf youth.

A random fun fact about me is that I took six semesters of Koine Greek language, which I learned to translate Hellenistic literature pieces, ~half of The Greek New Testament, and a personal favorite - Marcus Aurelius’ _Meditations_. But I lost most of my knowledge. 🤷

- For football/fútbol I root for Chicago Fire and Red Stars (both hometown), Tottenham Hotspur in Premier and Swansea City in Championship leagues, and Eintracht Frankfurt in Bundesliga. Still figuring out the other leagues.
