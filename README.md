Greetings Starbeing ‚Äî I‚Äôm Nick Ng (pronounced ‚Äòing‚Äô) and my pronouns are he/him/his. If I could live in any city, it would be pre-Yahoo Geocities.

This README is a work-in-progress, which I hope that it will be useful for anyone who collobrates with me.

In another dimension where software isn‚Äôt digesting the world ‚Äî career-wise, I would somehow find a way to have a dim sum teahouse / tempura bar in the spirit of [Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCGDVHjPX0c).

## Disabilities

I am deaf/hard-of-hearing (DHH). Culturally, I identify as Deaf and my primary language is American Sign Language (ASL). Regarding English spoken language, I had speech/auditory training for 15 years and am still struggling to pronounce words from time to time, like ‚Äúsupercalifragilisticexpialidocious.‚Äù Also, amblyopia that decreases vision in one of my eyes.

## Hobbies/Interests
I experiment in [creative coding](https://twitter.com/nickttng/status/1048245481548275712) in a variety of languages, mitigate stress by [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5682026-nick-ng), and find reasons to go for a walk (and to camp). Occasionally, I have heavy cases of [d√®s vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPKoIZn6IJI). 

On the side, I am a co-organizer lead at [A11yChi](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/), bringing together like-minded individuals advocating for accessibility and inclusive design. At [DeafKidsCode](https://www.deafkidscode.org/), I serve as a trustee to make technology learning accessible to Deaf youth.

A random fun fact about me is that I took six semesters of Koine Greek language, which I learned to translate Hellenistic literature pieces, ~half of The Greek New Testament, and a personal favorite - Marcus Aurelius‚Äô _Meditations_. But I lost most of my knowledge. ü§∑

- For football/f√∫tbol I root for Chicago Fire and Red Stars (both hometown), Tottenham Hotspur in Premier and Swansea City in Championship leagues, and Eintracht Frankfurt in Bundesliga. Still figuring out the other leagues.
