Greetings, Starbeing üëæ ‚Äî Hi, I‚Äôm Nick Ng (pronounced ing)‚Äîmy pronouns are he/him/his. If I could live in any city, it would be pre-Yahoo Geocities.

This README is a work-in-progress, but I hope it proves helpful to anyone collaborating with me. Here's a glimpse into who I am and what I care about:

What I do
  - UX Ops Lead at Login.gov, improving government digital identity experience for the American public
  - Soon: Explore HCI-AI Systems via Cambridge (Online)

What I think about
  - Accessibility challenges and opportunities in biometrics and authenticators
  - Threat modeling for UX - risks and care
  - Throwing and being thrown in Judo training
    - Newaza, also, is one of the most exhausting - and satisfying - experiences.
  - Food (in)security: I volunteer alongside incredible people to co-organize a local community pantry

In the past
  - On hiatus: [Accessibility Chicago (A11yChi)](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/) co-organizer lead
  - Served as a product design practice lead at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)
  - Craved omurice, omurice, omurice üç≥üçöüî¥
  
In another dimension where software isn‚Äôt digesting the world ‚Äî career-wise, I would somehow find a way to have a dim sum teahouse / tempura bar in the spirit of [Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCGDVHjPX0c).

## Disabilities

I am Deaf/Hard of Hearing (DHH) and culturally identify as Deaf. My primary language is American Sign Language (ASL). As for spoken English, I had 15 years of speech and auditory training but still occasionally struggle with pronunciation‚Äîlike tackling tongue twisters such as ‚Äúsupercalifragilisticexpialidocious.‚Äù Additionally, I have amblyopia, which reduces vision in one of my eyes.

## Hobbies/Interests
I experiment in [creative coding](https://twitter.com/nickttng/status/1048245481548275712) in a variety of languages, mitigate stress by [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5682026-nick-ng), and find reasons to go for a walk (and to camp). Occasionally, I have heavy cases of [d√®s vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPKoIZn6IJI). 

On the side, I am a co-organizer lead at [A11yChi](https://www.meetup.com/a11ychi/), bringing together like-minded individuals advocating for accessibility and inclusive design. At [DeafKidsCode](https://www.deafkidscode.org/), I serve as a trustee to make technology learning accessible to Deaf youth.

A random fun fact about me is that I took six semesters of Koine Greek language, which I learned to translate Hellenistic literature pieces, ~half of The Greek New Testament, and a personal favorite - Marcus Aurelius‚Äô _Meditations_. But I lost most of my knowledge. ü§∑

- For football/f√∫tbol I root for Chicago Fire and Red Stars (both hometown), Tottenham Hotspur in Premier and Swansea City in Championship leagues, and Eintracht Frankfurt in Bundesliga. Still figuring out the other leagues.
